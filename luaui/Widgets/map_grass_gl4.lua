----------IMPORTANT USAGE INSTRUCTIONS/ README----------

-- The grass configuration is set in the following order:
-- Defaults are in grassConfig
-- Any values in mapinfo.lua s  mapinfo.custom.grassConfig table is merged into the default
-- Any further params in mapOverrides table is merged into grassConfig table
-- The distribution of grass by default is taken (smartly) from the maps original grass map, or the grassDistTGA param of the config
-- grassDistTGA _must_ be 8 bit greyscale tga, mapSize[X|Z] / patchResolution sized
-- Commands to load/save grass:
-- /loadgrass [filename] : loads a grass distribution from filename path, defaults to VFS_root [mapName]_grassDist.tga
-- /savegrass [filename] : saves the grass distribution to filename path, defaults to VFS_root [mapName]_grassDist.tga
-- /cleargrass : Sets the entire map to have 0 sized grass
-- /editgrass : allows you to edit the already defined grass (either from mapSMFgrass, or grassDistTGA, if specified)
-- /dumpgrassshaders : dumps shaders
-- UI to paint grass:
	-- Once placement mode has been toggled with /loadgrass or /cleargrass or /editgrass
	-- use the '[' and ']' keys to change brush size
	-- use the left mouse button to make the grass grow, right mouse button to make it small/disappear
	-- hold shift to paint max height grass/ fully remove grass
	-- I also recommend binding toggle grass widget to alt+f for fast colorization reloading in uikeys.txt
	-- If you want to change colorization, and want to save your 'painting progress', do /savegrass, reload the widget, then /loadgrass
	-- NOTE: Shader load is MUCH higher in editing mode, and especially on large maps (pushing 10's of millions of vertices)

-- Load Order
-- 1. Parse Mapinfo
--     -- if grass params exist, use them
-- 2. Parse Overrides-------------------
--     -- if overrides exist, use them
-- 3. cleargrass or loadgrass overrides, and enables placement mode
-- 4. enable placementMode -- this should reload the instance VBO, but keep any parsed params
-- 5. Separate autograss function
-- 6. GrassDistTexture overrides builtin grass

--------- TODO/ DEVNOTES: -------------------------------------------
-- Todo:
-- do all of this in geom shader to do early LOD culling
-- customizable shadowmap sample size
-- grass UV offsets multiplier

-- issues:
--	Pretty high vertex shader load :/
-- 	anisotropic transparency - where quads viewed from their edge should be transparent :)
-- 	fix darkening on distort to be better?
